# Wolf Distribution in Valle d'Aosta and Relationship with Urban Hotspots (2019–2025)

## Project Description
This project analyzes the spatial distribution of wolves in Valle d'Aosta from 2019 to 2025 and their relationship with urban hotspots. The goal is to identify patterns of presence in relation to human settlements, highlighting areas with higher frequency of sightings and potential conflict zones.

The analysis uses georeferenced data from the **GIBIF database** and GIS layers of urban areas. It combines distribution maps, heatmaps, distance calculations from urban centers, and statistical charts of distances.

## Analyses Performed
1. **Data Exploration**
   - Cleaning and validation of records.  
   - Temporal distribution and data source overview.

2. **Spatial Analysis**
   - Maps of georeferenced wolf sightings.  
   - Overlay with urban centers.  
   - Heatmaps to highlight presence hotspots.

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Calculation of distances from each record to the nearest urban center.  
   - Descriptive statistics and charts of distances.  
   - Comparison between areas with high vs low human density.

4. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Segmentation of data in recent periods to detect changes in proximity to settlements.

## Project Limitations
- Coverage limited to 2019–2025.  
- Cannot estimate actual wolf population density.  
- Proximity analysis depends on the accuracy of urban center data.

## Tools Used
- **QGIS** → Geospatial data management and mapping.  
- **Python/R** → Statistical analysis and charting.  
- **GIS layers** of Valle d'Aosta urban centers.
