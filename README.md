# üê∫ Human‚ÄìWolf Coexistence in Italy (2005‚Äì2025)

## Overview

This project explores the **relationship between human presence and wolf (*Canis lupus*) distribution in Italy** using open-access occurrence data from **GBIF** (Global Biodiversity Information Facility).  
The dataset covers the period **2005‚Äì2025**, integrating both **scientific records and citizen-science observations** from across the country.

The analysis aims to:
- Investigate how wolf occurrence varies across **Northern, Central, and Southern Italy**.
- Examine whether **human population density** correlates with the frequency of wolf observations.
- Visualize these patterns through maps and summary statistics produced with **QGIS** and, optionally, **R**.

## Objectives

1. **Assess the spatial distribution** of wolves in Italy from GBIF records.  
2. **Compare occurrence density** across macro-areas (North, Center, South).  
3. **Evaluate human‚Äìwolf coexistence** by relating observation frequency to human population density.  
4. Produce **visual and quantitative outputs** suitable for ecological interpretation and communication.

## Data Sources

### 1. Wolf occurrences
- **Source:** GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)  
- **Species:** *Canis lupus*  
- **Years considered:** 2005‚Äì2025  
- **Type of data:** Museum records, scientific surveys, and citizen-science reports (e.g. iNaturalist)  
- **Main cleaning steps:**
  - Removed non-wolf taxa (e.g. *Canis lupus familiaris*)  
  - Checked and standardized coordinates and taxonomic fields  
  - Removed duplicates and invalid records  
  - Added a column for **macro-area** (North, Central, South)  

### 2. Human population data
- **Source:** Publicly available demographic dataset (aggregated by age and sex)  
- Data were **summed to obtain total resident population per region**, ensuring comparability with the GBIF records.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
Data were cleaned and standardized manually in **Excel**, following the steps above.  
The cleaned dataset was then saved as CSV and imported into **QGIS** for spatial analysis.

### 2. Mapping in QGIS
- Loaded **regional shapefiles of Italy** as base layers.  
- Imported wolf occurrence points from GBIF.  
- Added population data to the same spatial framework.  
- Grouped observations by macro-area (North, Central, South).  
- Created density maps and visual overlays showing wolf occurrences vs. population distribution.

### 3. (Optional) Quantitative Analysis
Future extensions of this project may include:
- Computing wolf occurrences per 1,000 inhabitants per macro-area.  
- Evaluating temporal trends in wolf reports over the 2005‚Äì2025 period.  
- Statistical tests in **R** to quantify correlation between human density and observation frequency.
